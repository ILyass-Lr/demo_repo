# Introduction to Git & GitHub

You do that by clicking **Add file > Create new file**, enter its name and then clicking the green _Commit changes_ button at the top-right corner

For this Demo we are creating and committing a README.md file

<u>Note:</u> GitHub can render md files, and by default render the .md file found in your repository, generally bieng the READNE.md file.

After Clicking on _Commit changes_, you'll be prompted to enter a Commit message describing the new changes related to this commit.
